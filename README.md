# Advance Attendence System Using Computer Vision.

Computer vision is a field of artificial intelligence (AI) that enables
computers and systems to derive meaningful information from digital images,
videos and other visual inputs(cameras) and take actions required such as
Marking attendance, Recommendations based on that information. Face
recognition is a biometric technique that determines whether the image of a
person's face matches any of the face images stored in a database.Every Face has some
characteristics that make it different from everyone elseâ€™s.


*The primary goal of this project is to build a face recognition-based
attendance monitoring system for students attending college, college staff and
employees working in an organization in order to improve and upgrade the
current attendance system to make it more efficient and effective than before. The
student/employee should be in an area that has good lighting so that the camera
detects the face clearly and the mark their attendance.*
